## Developing a new extension

I'll assume that you already read the Webpack docs and the Chrome Extension docs.

Check if your Node.js version is >= 6.
Clone the repository.
Install yarn.
Run yarn.
Change the package's name and description on package.json.
Change the name of your extension on src/manifest.json.
Run yarn run start
Load your extension on Chrome following:
Access chrome://extensions/
Check Developer mode
Click on Load unpacked extension
Select the build folder.
Have fun.
